# Drift State

A small JS helper to give your CSS transitions a transitioning (aka drifting) state.

## Polyfills
The library uses the following features, which you'll need to polyfill if not supported:
- classList
- Array.forEach
- querySelector/querySelectorAll
- addEventListener/removeEventListener
